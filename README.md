# MovieApp
iOS test assignment: Movies app with list, details, search, sort and filter using TMDb API

## TMDb API Key Setup

Before launching the app, please add your TMDb API key:

1. Copy the file [`Secrets.plist.example`](Secrets.plist.example) and rename it to `Secrets.plist`.
2. Paste your real API key from [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api) into the `TMDB_API_KEY` field.
3. Place the `Secrets.plist` file into the **Resources** folder.
4. Make sure the `Secrets.plist` file is not committed to the repository (it is already listed in `.gitignore`).
